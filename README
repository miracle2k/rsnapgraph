----------
What is it?

  rsnapgraph is a utility that will analyze the snapshot backups created
  by rsnapshot (http://www.rsnapshot.org), and produce two graphs showing
  file and disk space changes over time.

  - The rsnapshot-files.png graph shows the number of files created and
    deleted between each snapshot, as well as a running graph showing the
    total number of files in each snapshot.

  - The rsnapshot-size graph shows the amount of disk space being freed or
    used by each snapshot, as well as a running graph showing the total
    amount of disk space used by each snapshot.

  It's useful to know whether the snapshots are very volatile, and if so,
  which directories.  If disk space is tight, then this can help identify
  directories within each snapshot which can be removed from the snapshot
  to save space.  Plus the graphs are pretty.


----------
Requirements
  - a set of rsnapshot directories (see http://www.rsnapshot.org)
  - Perl v5 with the File::Find module (should be there by default I believe)
  - gnuplot v4 or better (3.7 may work, could it plot inline data?)
  - something to view PNG graphic files (Firefox, GQView, etc)


----------
Installing
  - the default install prefix is /usr/local: edit Makefile to change
  - run "make install": this will put the rsnapgraph executable in 
    /usr/local/bin, and the rsnapgraph.conf configuration file in /etc
  - edit the /etc/rsnapgraph.conf file, setting the following parameters:
     - rootdir: this should be set to the directory containing the rsnapshot
       managed directories, ie. the same value as snapshot_root in the
       rsnapshot.conf file
     - workdir: this should be set to a directory to which only root can
       read and write (for security reasons), so its permissions should
       be 700; it specifies the directory in which a cached copy of the
       data files are kept, to reduce the processing overhead on subsequent
       runs
     - graphdir: this should be set to a directory to which only root can
       write (for security reasons), although anyone can read from it; it
       specifies the directory into which rsnapgraph will create the graph
       images
  - other parameters are described in the rsnapshot.conf file


----------
Running
  - if the /etc/rsnapgraph.conf has been set up, you just need to run
    'rsnapgraph'
  - the various rsnapgraph.conf settings can be overridden on the command
    line: run 'rsnapgraph -h' for details


----------
Results
  - the green and red bars show increase (green) and decrease (red) in
    either the number of files or the used disk space; these bars are
    measured against the left Y axis
  - the blue line shows the number of files in or total space used by each
    of the snapshot directories, and is measured against the right Y axis


----------
Further Configuration
  I call rsnapgraph nightly, after I call rsnapshot, and put the results on
  my web page: http://denism.homeip.net/graphs/rsnapgraph-data.html

  The crontab entry to do this looks like:

45 04  * * * /usr/local/bin/rsnapgraph 1> /tmp/rsnapgraph.out 2>&1
